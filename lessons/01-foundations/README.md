## 💬 Instructor Notes

> **Tip:** Don't worry if you still don't understand how it works technically. The following lessons cover Docker, databases, etc. For now, you only need to understand WHAT n8n does and WHY it's useful.

> **Important:** This course assumes you already know WHAT you want to automate. If you're not clear on your use cases yet, that's fine. As you learn to implement n8n, more ideas will come to you.
