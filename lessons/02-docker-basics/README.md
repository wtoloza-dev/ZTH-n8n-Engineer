## 💬 Instructor Notes

> **Tip:** Docker can seem complex at first, but for n8n you only need to understand a few key concepts. Focus on understanding containers, images, and volumes - these are the building blocks.

> **Important:** You don't need to be a Docker expert to deploy n8n. This lesson covers exactly what you need to know - no more, no less.
